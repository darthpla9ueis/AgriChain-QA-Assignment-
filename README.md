# AgriChain-QA-Assignment-

This is an updated, fresh attempt at solving the assignment questions. I have branched this to store the newer solutions.

1) The solution to the first question is uploaded under a .py file named "Ques1 nested.py" and 'Ques1 sliding window.py". The first solution is written entirely without much or any help and ends up using a brute force solution, as for the second attempt towards the same question, I dive into understanding the sliding window method and resulting in writing the second solution.
 
2) The solution to the second question is uploaded in the form of two Google Sheets that note down all the manual and automated test cases I would test, and for the second part of the question, I take the "Test Function 07", which deals with "Edge Case: String with special characters", and write an automation test code using selenium and python under the file uploaded as "Automated Testing for TF 07.py".
